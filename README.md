# referee-helper
I created this application to help referee's with managing their schedule. I have since abandoned this project to work on other things.

Looking at it today there are many things I would change and improve. One is largely the process in which I developed this app.
Thanks to working on this, I learned when to use jobs and when to use an API. 
I learned how to focus on feature development and testing. I also learned that web scraping is a PITA.
